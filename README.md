# Property-prediction-ML-model
This machine learning model helps us to predict desired properties of biopolymers. 

At first, the data in the form of PDFs are uploaded and the required data will be 
extracted using PyPDF2 and will be converted into a dataframe.

Then various models are trained using selected input features and output labels.

Here, I have used Linear regression, SVM, Random forest and ANNs to predict the properties.
In this case, I have used these models to predict only one output label, i.e TENSILE MODULUS.
